# Mini Kafka

The Mini-Kafka Docker project is a containerized solution that emulates the essential components of Apache Kafka, offering a simplified yet powerful messaging system. It harnesses the capabilities of Docker containers to effortlessly deploy a Kafka broker and ZooKeeper, the coordination service. 
### Checkpoints:

	ERROR CODES:
